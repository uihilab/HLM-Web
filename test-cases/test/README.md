# Constant Runoff Model

## About

This example simulates the rainfall-runoff response of a Test watershed using the constant runoff model. 
The network has 11 links.
An image of the network topology is below.
Using the default settings provided in this example, the simulation takes less than 1 second of wall time to run a 24-hour simulation.

- Network Name: Test
- Outlet Drainage Area: 0.64 km<sup>2</sup>
- Number of Links: 11
